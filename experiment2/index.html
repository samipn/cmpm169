			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animation & Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started with some code from the examples given to us on the generative p5 website. With that as my base I moved on to making my piece more chaotic.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I used more interesting techniques that I found within multiple examples to make lines that come through in a random sort of way.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I used the code to make something unique by allowing it to mesh together better. To accomplish this I added randomness wherever I could.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I did this project by myself.</li>
					<li>I liked my end product it got the feel that I was going for, more info is in my pdf.</li>
					<li>The low of this project was trying to make everything mesh together. The high of the project was making everything work together and still be very random.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

				<h2>Results</h2>
