			<h1>Experiment 6 - Grammars & Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this step, I went ahead and looked for cool text art where the text was animated and able to be interacted with. I found many cool projects to help me acheive this.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>To integrate, I went through the text art and found stuff that would work well with each other and ultimately decided on a cut off effect.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I used that cut off effect to make something that looks cool, while also messing around with the radius of the circle and how the colors change.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I did this project solo</li>
					<li>I liked the work as it allows for cool effects and can be zoomed in and out which is fun.</li>
					<li>The lows were when nothing worked well, and the highs was making it work properly. Scroll all the way down to see the canvas.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<div id="canvas-container">
					<!-- canvas will be added here -->
