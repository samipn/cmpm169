			<h1>Experiment 4 - Images, Video, & Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>Looking for inspiration, I was going for a pattern theme using video and pixels as the medium. I was able to find some examples that got the pixels the way I wanted, and so I used that as a base.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>Trying to fit the pieces together was tough, but I was able to mess around with the values of how the pixels were recorded and then I was able to make something that worked, but was very basic.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>To innovate, I took the code and made it work together, so it created an effect of both circular and square pixels, that when shown at different light levels changes the way it looks. It also has a pattern normally that gets effected by the light.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I did this solo.</li>
					<li>I am happy with my work, as I thought I had to make it super complex, but in the end the simplicity was just better.</li>
					<li>The lows were when everything would break and I would have to restart my tab over and over trying to make things work. The high was getting it to finally work, and getting something coherent, and not random. Scroll all the way down, and use a webcam to see the work.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
