			<h1>Experiment 7 - Data Visualization & Networks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I decided I wanted to do easy to read data visualization. So I decided to look on openprocessing and found a lot of cool examples of complex ways to represnt data, but then I found some good simple ones too.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>So I decided on a bar chart, and with that I used it in p5js, because I didn't want it to be preloaded.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>For this step, I decided to make it show local data of Santa Cruz weather, and show the highest temperatures recorded in 2023 for each month.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I did this project solo.</li>
					<li>The work was fine, it did what I wanted in making it easy to understand.</li>
					<li>The lows were making it simple and clean, and all the other versions not working. The high was getting it working and looking nice.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<div id="canvas-container">
					<!-- canvas will be added here -->
