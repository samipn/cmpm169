			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Methods</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started by wanting a circluar theme, and then going on open processing to find inspiration.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>Once I had a few samples I decided to mesh them togther and make sure one doesnt overpower the other.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>To innovate, I made it so the lines that were non visible before became visible, so then it wraps around the entire canvas giving the circles a base to play around.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I made this project solo.</li>
					<li>Overall, I am very happy with this project as it started off very different to how it ended, but that is ok because I love the end product.</li>
					<li>The lows were trying to make everything mesh well with each other, and not have them overpower each other. The high was making everything come together and then seeing the final product and how unique it is every time you refresh the page. 
					</li>
				</ul>
