			<h1>Experiment 5 - 3D Graphics</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started with a sphere, and then I branched out, by using curves and lines to see what I could make. I also found a lot of cool 3D art with landscapes and even ducks.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>To integrate, I took what I saw, and made it mesh together. First was the sphere and curves, then the math lines came in the end.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>For the final product, I combined all the parts to make everything fit well. And now you can move around the sphere and scroll in and out to zoom and see a different perspective.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked on this project solo.</li>
					<li>I am happy with the work I did, and I think I made a cool final product.</li>
					<li>The lows were trying to make everything fit and not overlap each other. The high was getting everything together and settling on the final color scheme. Scroll all the way down to see the canvas.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<div id="canvas-container">
					<!-- canvas will be added here -->
